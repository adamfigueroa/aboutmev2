                        <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer living in beautiful Bend, Oregon.</p>
                        <p>Here is a bit of information about me:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I love nature, I feel most at home when I am out hiking and camping.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Philosophy inspires me on a daily basis, I am constantly thinking about the pupose of
                                life/morals/the universe etc. Its like a puzzle thats fun to solve which is probably why
                                I chose to be a Software Engineer; I enjoy solving problems.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Music has always been in my life, as far back as I can remember I have been able to
                                harmonize to any music I hear. I also sing and play guitar.</li>

                        <p>Throughout my past careers; whether it was customer service, cellular sales, or tech
                            production I found that my favorite aspects of those jobs was when I was a part of a team in
                            pursuit of a goal or learning about new technologies and how they came to be. This is what
                            sparked an interest in pursuing a career in Software Engineering.</p>
                        <p>Outside of my growing passion for web development I enjoy hanging out with friends, DMing for
                            my Dungeons and Dragons group, spending as much time outdoors as I can and camping any
                            chance I get!</p>
                        <p>Got a project you are working on that needs a bit more pizzazz? You can find my contact
